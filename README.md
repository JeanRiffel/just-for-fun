# Just for Fun

This repository is a personal systems playground.

Here I explore networking, memory, and low-level concepts to reconnect with the fundamentals of technology and experiment freely outside my daily professional routine.

There are no production goals, no strict standards — just curiosity-driven coding and hands-on learning.

This is not a corporate project. It’s simply a space to think, build, and enjoy the process.

Let’s have fun.
